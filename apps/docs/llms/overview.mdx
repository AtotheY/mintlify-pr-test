SpinAI now supports a broader range of LLMs (Large Language Models) for enhanced agent decision-making capabilities. This document provides an overview of all supported LLMs, including the newly added Cloudflare and custom HTTP LLM integrations.

## Existing LLM Integrations

SpinAI has been supporting several LLMs, each offering unique features and capabilities:

- [OpenAI](/llms/openai): Known for its GPT models, OpenAI provides versatile AI models suitable for a wide range of applications.
- [Anthropic](/llms/anthropic): Offers Claude, a model designed for safety and reliability in AI interactions.

Each LLM can be configured with custom settings, including:

- Model selection
- Temperature
- Token limits
- API configuration

## New Integrations

SpinAI is expanding its LLM support to include:

- [Cloudflare](/llms/cloudflare): Leverage Cloudflare's global network to deploy and scale your LLM applications with ease.
- [Custom HTTP LLM](/llms/http-llm): Integrate any LLM that offers an HTTP API, providing flexibility to use specialized models not directly supported.

These new integrations offer additional flexibility and control, allowing users to tailor their LLM usage to specific needs and scenarios.

## Choosing an LLM

When selecting an LLM for your project, consider the following factors:

- **Cost per token**: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness based on your usage patterns.
- **Response quality**: Consider the model's performance and the relevance of its responses.
- **API reliability**: Ensure the API's uptime and responsiveness meet your requirements.
- **Token context limits**: Be aware of the maximum token limits, as they can impact the complexity of the prompts you can use.
