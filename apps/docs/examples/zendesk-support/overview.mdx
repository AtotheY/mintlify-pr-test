description: "Building a Zendesk Support AI Agent"
---

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to build an AI agent that helps customer support teams by integrating with Zendesk Support. The agent will be able to:

1. Retrieve ticket information from Zendesk
2. Analyze ticket content and customer history
3. Suggest appropriate responses
4. Update tickets with AI-generated responses

## Prerequisites

- A Zendesk Support account
- Zendesk API credentials (Admin token)
- Spinai installed in your project

## Workflow Overview

Here's how our AI agent will process support tickets:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Ticket] --> B[fetchTicket]
    B --> C[analyzeTicket]
    C --> D{Need More Info?}
    D -->|Yes| E[generateClarification]
    D -->|No| F[generateResponse]
    E --> G[updateTicket]
    F --> G
    G --> H{Resolved?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Close Ticket]
    H -->|No| J[Wait for Reply]
    J --> B
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Triage**: Automatically categorize and prioritize tickets
2. **Consistent Responses**: Generate standardized yet personalized responses
3. **Efficiency**: Reduce response time and agent workload
4. **Learning**: Improve responses over time through feedback
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Zendesk workflows
