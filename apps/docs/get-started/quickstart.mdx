## Create a New Project

Use our CLI to create a new SpinAI project:

```bash
npm create spinai-app@latest my-first-agent
cd my-first-agent
```

## Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Create an Action

Create a new file `src/actions/getWeather.ts`:

```typescript
import { createAction } from "spinai";

export const getWeather = createAction({
  id: "getWeather",
  description: "Get the current weather for a location",
  async run(context) {
    context.state.weather = {
      temp: 72,
      condition: "sunny",
    };
    return context;
  },
});
```

## Create Your Agent

Update `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { createAgent, createOpenAILLM } from "spinai";
import { getWeather } from "./actions/getWeather";

const weatherAgent = createAgent({
  instructions: "Help users get weather information",
  actions: [getWeather],
  llm: createOpenAILLM({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  }),
});

const { response } = await weatherAgent({
  input: "What's the weather like?",
  state: {},
});
```

## Run Your Agent

Start your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your agent will now:

1. Receive the user's question
2. Decide to use the getWeather action
3. Execute the action
4. Provide a response
