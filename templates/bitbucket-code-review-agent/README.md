## Setting Up Bitbucket Webhook

   - Triggers: Select "Pull Request: Created" and "Pull Request: Updated"
   - Skip SSL verification for testing (enable for production)

For local testing:
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# In another terminal, create a tunnel
ngrok http 3000
```

Use the ngrok URL as your webhook URL in Bitbucket settings.

## Usage

### Automatic Reviews
1. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. The bot will automatically:
   - Review new PRs when they're opened
   - Review PRs when new changes are pushed
   - Add line-specific comments with suggestions
   - Add a summary comment on the PR

### Manual PR Review API
You can trigger a manual code review for any PR using the `/review-pr` endpoint.

#### Request
```bash
POST /review-pr
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "workspace": "your-workspace",
  "repo_slug": "your-repo",
  "pull_request_id": 123
}
```

#### Example using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/review-pr \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspace": "your-workspace",
    "repo_slug": "your-repo", 
    "pull_request_id": 123
  }'
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "message": "Manual review completed successfully",
  "response": "Review completed",
  "totalCostCents": 12,
  "totalDurationMs": 4500,
  "sessionId": "abc123",
  "interactionId": "def456"
}
```

#### Error Responses

#### Tips
1. You can use this API to:
   - Re-review a PR after changes
   - Review older PRs
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
2. The API uses the same review logic as automatic reviews
3. You can track review costs and durations in the response
